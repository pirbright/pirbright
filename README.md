# Hello :wave:

Welcome to my part of GitHub!  My name is Alex, and I'm a Software Developer/Engineer from [Winchester, United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester).  Coding runs in my family. My grandmother wrote machine code. My parents started with punch cards and moved onto COBOL.  For my part, I built my first website aged 16, which can be found [here](https://divein2008.maritimearchaeologytrust.org/), and I've been coding professionally for over five years.  I primarily work with Python and Django, Docker and Postgres, and I'm also conversant with Rust, Go, C and AWS, along with various database systems.

# Styles and Tools ðŸ§°

Every developer has style preferences. I aim for small functions and classes, to maximise test coverage and reduce complexity.  To achieve this, I utilise various tools including linters and formatters such as [black](https://github.com/psf/black) and [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff).  Additionally, I use VSCode and Sublime Text as text editors and Git for source control.
